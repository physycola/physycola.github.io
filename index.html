							<p>
								I am a theoretical physicist, in that I make use of mathematical and computational tools to investigate the natural world.
								My main area of research is into the <b>dynamics of plasmas</b> (partially- or fully-ionised gases) and the turbulence (chaotic, random motions) that they generate. 
								I have a particular interest in magnetic-confinement fusion,
								though I also work on plasma physics problems in astrophysical contexts, such the solar wind. For more details, visit the <a href="#research">research</a> page.

								A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)" target="_blank" class="new-tab-icon">plasma</a> is a partially- or fully-ionised gas 
								consisting of charged ions and electrons that interact through electromagnetic forces. 
								<br>
								<br>
								Sometimes referred to as the 'fourth state of matter', plasmas are prevalent throughout the universe, 
								constituting the majority of observable baryonic matter. 
								Given their ubiquity, it is unsurprising that the physics of plasmas is relevant in broad array of contexts:

								</a>,
								 and even the plasma displays that allow you to watch the latest TV drama.
								<br><br>
								My research focuses on <b>plasma turbulence</b> in both magnetic-confinement-fusion
								and solar-wind contexts, which I describe further below.

							<p style="margin-top:-1.25em">
								<b>Magnetic-confinement fusion</b>
								<br>
								Fusion power aims to generate electricity by harnessing the large amounts of energy that can be released in a nuclear fusion reaction, in which two lighter
								atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, liberating kinetic energy. The sun, like other stars, is a natural fusion reactor, consisting of a plasma 
								held together by gravitational forces.

								 target="_blank" 
								 class="new-tab-icon">
								 Magnetic-confinement fusion
								</a>
								(MCF) devices attempt to recreate these conditions on earth, making use of external electromagnetic coils to generate a series
								of nested magnetic field 'surfaces' that wrap around the toroidal (i.e., doughnut-shaped) vessel and help confine the plasma. Unfortunately for the fusion 
								programme, heat and particle losses in 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak#:~:text=A%20tokamak%20(%2F%CB%88to%CA%8A,of%20an%20axially%20symmetrical%20torus."

								and (neoclassically optimised) 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellarator" 
								 target="_blank" 
								 class="new-tab-icon">
								 stellarators
								</a>
								are dominated by turbulence: a random ensemble of small-scale fluctuations that renders the behaviour of the plasma difficult to predict and often leads to a 
								degradation in the plasma confinement.

								The majority of my research effort is dedicated to investigating instabilities and turbulence in high-beta fusion plasmas 
								(e.g.,
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_tokamak" 
								 target="_blank" 
								 class="new-tab-icon">
								 spherical tokamaks
								</a> 
								), in which the magnetic-field perturbations 
								generated by the plasma itself compete with the externally imposed magnetic field. Although most reactor-relevant designs are set to operate in the
								electromagnetic regime, comparatively little is understood about the associated turbulence: we have not yet fully characterised its mechanisms of injection 
								and saturation, its transport properties, its ability to support reduced transport states, etc. I delve into these questions using a combination of analytical and 
								computational tools, often within the
								<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0034-4885/76/11/116201"

								<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-plasma-physics/article/abs/electromagnetic-instabilities-and-plasma-turbulence-driven-by-electrontemperature-gradient/AC4CDF365BB9B431FBDF5C1820D1D619"

								<b>Solar-wind turbulence</b>
								<br>
								The solar corona, the Sun's outer atmosphere, is astonishingly hot, with temperatures reaching millions of degrees, far hotter than those at the surface. This intense heat, 
								along with the slow, often chaotic motion of structures like 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_loop" 
								 target="_blank" 
								 class="new-tab-icon">
								 coronal loops 
								</a>
								, drives the solar wind: a continuous stream of turbulent plasma that flows outward from the Sun. The interaction 
								of this solar wind with the Earth's 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere" 
								 target="_blank" 
								 class="new-tab-icon">
								 magnetosphere 
								</a>
								is responsible for the magnificent polar auroras that are observed at higher latitudes. 
								
								<br><br>
								The plasma that makes up the solar wind is primarily collisionless, meaning its characteristic dynamics are much faster than those associated with inter-particle collisions. 
								Given that these collisions are the mechanism usually responsible for equailising the temperatures of the species (electrons and ions) that make up the plasma, a key question 
								is what then determines the partitioning of turbulent energy between them. In particular, ions are observed to be hotter than electrons even though the most 
								'straightforward' theories of plasma turbulence predict the opposite.
								
								<br><br>
								A possible explanation for this preferential heating of ions is the so-called 'helicity barrier' that emerges when the energy in the turbulent fluctuations
							    propagating away from the Sun is much greater than in those propagating towards it. In this regime, nonlinear conservation laws prevent the energy from reaching
								small spatial scales where it would typically be absorbed by electrons, causing it to instead build up in large-scale structures and heat ions. 
								The signatures of helicity-barrier mediated turbulence (e.g., steep 'transition range' energy spectra), are supported by in-situ observations like those made by NASA's 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe" 
								 target="_blank" 
								 class="new-tab-icon">
								 Parker Solar Probe 
								</a>
								. My work focuses on characterising the conditions under which the helicity barrier arises and understanding its implications for turbulent heating in the solar wind.
